# Displacement Energy map (DEmap)
A data-efficient code to machine learn the threshold displacement energy surface using Gaussian Processes. This program facilitates rapid determination of the Displacement energy surface. 

# Installation

DEmap has been tested with python 3.11.13. It acts as a driver script for LAMMPS, therefore a working installation of LAMMPS is required. The package can be simply installed with the following command:
```
pip install demap
```
Requirements:
- Pytorch
- Gpytroch 
- numpy
- ovito

# Usage

For instructions on the usage of DEmap, please consult the manual.
